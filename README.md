The design should be responsive. 

The calculator should be aligned in the middle of screen in both orientations (horizontally and vertically).

For mobile version, the complex operations should be hidden as in the right calculator.

We should be able to enter the expression via mouse click or directly from the keyboard.

Evaluating the expression should handle operator precedence. So, the expression 9+3*2-3 equals 12 not 21.

Handling parenthesized expression is an advantage. For example:  (3+2)*3-3*(6-1) = 0  whih

There is no need to handle complex operation: log, sqrt, â€¦.
